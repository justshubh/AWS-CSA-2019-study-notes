================

This is my collection of notes from the
[A Cloud Guru | AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate - 2019](https://www.udemy.com/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate/) course.

Speacial thanks to  Ryan Kroonenburg and ACloudGuru Team and also to Alessio Casco.

## What it is

The A cloud Guru course is huge and in order to explain to you the basic concepts, it has sometimes to give you pieces of information that are not required to be known in order to pass the exam. So my intent here is to save in one place everything the exam requires you to know without the other stuff.

## What it is not

This is not a substitution of the course, you MUST go through the course to be able to pass the exam, it's just a place where you can revise and have all the notions in one single location.
